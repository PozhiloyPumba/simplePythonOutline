# My simple outline 
### this is simple outline of python3 code, which create local database of global object in file (functions and classes)

## For run this code enter:
```
$ python3 main.py files
```
## Where files it is your files from which you want to get global objects to table in funcAndClass.db which is called GlobalObjects and consists from:
- filename : relative name of source this object
- type : type of object (Class or Function)
- name : name of object
- args : arguments of function if exists (if it is Class this field is empty and if function doesn't have arguments it is 'does not have arguments')
- beginDef : object definition start line
- endDef : object definition end line
